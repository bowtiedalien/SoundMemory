Today, Medium level's algorithm works! and I did it in a much simpler way than I intended. The code reduced from tens of lines to a few 5 lines or something. I'm very happy about that.
Then I also added a bit of animation or tweaning as the link above says. I imported a package for it from the Asset store and it was very easy to use! It's very fun. I have a few more things to do before the game can be considered working. 

Oh and I solved the a bug in the last screen where the button was not clicking and it came like an inspiration subhanAllah.

I still have to link all help icons and settings icons and see if I should add a timer, and also add an algorithm to the lives.
