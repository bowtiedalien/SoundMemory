Day 1   Thursday    16/4/2020

I woke up late today, at 11:30. And I had a lecture at 2. As soon as I woke up, I opened up my laptop to answer some of Pelin's questions. And then I soon got stuck inside Unity, trying to write the code for the Medium level. I was trying to manage the toggles as a first step; to restrict the user to select only two toggles, and I couldn't. It took me two hours or so, then my lecture started and I was still unable to do it. I got different errors every time. 
My approach was trying to store the clicked toggles in an array of fixed size = 2. And whenever user tries to click another toggle, he can not unless he deselects one of the selected ones. 
Right now, I'm stuck at a stack overflow error and sometimes if I make some changes, I may get an index overflow error. 
I still can not fix it. Medium level is not working at all yet. Easy Level is finished. But I've spent way too much time today trying to do it, and I'm sick of it. So I'm just gonna stop right now.
