Day 1   Thursday    16/4/2020

Since it is my first time ever developing a game, and since I tend to get engrossed in the details and the code bugs most of the time that I forget the big picture, I should have really started a day-by-day diary about this experience from the first day. 
But it did not occur to me until a few moments ago. And I've been developing Sound Memory for almost a month. But anyways, now is as good as any time to start documenting. It's always good to document. Especially in my world.

In order for this series of entries to be sequential, I will try to recall what I did in the past few weeks and in what days/dates they were done, until I reach today. And then, starting from today, I'll be writing at the end of each day inshaAllah.
